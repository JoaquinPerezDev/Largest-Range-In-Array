# Largest-Range-In-Array

ALGO EXPERT HARD

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array of length 2 representing the largest range of integers contained in an array.<br>
The first number in the output array should be the first number in the rande, while the second number should be the last number in the range. <br>
A range of numbers is defined as a set of numbers that come right after each other in the set of real integers. For instance, the output array [2, 6]<br> represents the range {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, which is a range of length 5. Note that numbers don't need to be sorted or adjacent in the input array in order to<br> form a range. You can assume that there will only be one largest range. 

Sample input: array = [1, 11, 3, 0, 15, 5, 2, 4, 10, 7, 12, 6]<br>
Sample output: [0, 7]<br>
